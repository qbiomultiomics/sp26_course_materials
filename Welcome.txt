Welcome to QBIO490!

Transitioning from traditional courses to a research lab can be challenging, as many critical scientific skills are not taught in the classroom setting. QBIO490: Multi-Omic Data Analysis was developed to ease this transition in a low-stakes supportive environment and to also facilitate a stronger community among QBIO students. We hope this course will provide you all with opportunities to learn and grow as students and as researchers!
